## Kickoff
With your guidance, I'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
Please note that I'll only request specific code snippets as we progress,
so there's no need to provide code until I explicitly ask for it.
Are you ready to start?

## HTML Structure
Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
It should have the following buttons, horizontally one line with 20px padding: 
MUSIC, WRITING, PAINTING, PHOTOGRAPHY. Each image will have a link to a landing page.
Also, include a footer.


## Header and Navigation
Please code an HTML header displaying my name, "EyeBox Productions," and navigation links for each of the 4 buttons above.

## About Section
Now guide me to create the HTML for a separate button: ABOUT. the about section. It should link to the BIO page, not yet created.

## Skills Section
Now let's code the HTML for my skills section. 

Letâ€™s start with the skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
Each skill should have a name and a description. I also want to display
a progress bar representing my proficiency in each skill.
